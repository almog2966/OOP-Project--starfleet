# StarFleet: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

# Overview

A comprehensive Java-based software system designed for managing an advanced space fleet. This project leverages the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to model the intricacies of a spacefaring armada. Through the use of interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance, StarFleet brings to life the various spacecraft types and their crew members, crafting a vivid simulation of space fleet operations.

# Features

Dynamic Spacecraft Representation: Classes meticulously designed to represent different types of spacecraft, complete with their unique attributes and functionalities.
Crew Management: Detailed modeling of crew members, utilizing OOP to encapsulate their roles, responsibilities, and interactions within the spacecraft.
Advanced Fleet Reports: Generate insightful reports about the fleet, covering key metrics such as total maintenance costs and the overall firepower of the fleet, enhancing strategic decision-making.
Utilization of OOP Principles: A showcase of interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance to build a scalable and modular software architecture.
